  ⚠️  No forward secrecy yet
  ⚠️  Onion routing not activated
  ⚠️  ZK proofs not integrated

NEXT PRIORITIES (Week 11-13)
-----------------------------

1. Replace dev key derivation with DH exchange (X25519 + ML-KEM)
2. Implement forward secrecy with ratcheting
3. Integrate ZK RLN proofs with messaging
4. Fix Groth16 circuit for production zkSNARKs
5. Performance optimization (<1.5s proof target)

TESTING
-------

Run Tests:
  cargo test --workspace

Try CLI:
  # Terminal 1
  ./target/release/umbra start -u alice -p 9000
  
  # Terminal 2
  ./target/release/umbra start -u bob -c "/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/9000/quic-v1/p2p/<PEER_ID>"
